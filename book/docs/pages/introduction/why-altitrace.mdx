# Why Altitrace?

Transaction simulation is critical for modern DeFi development, but existing solutions often fall short when working with HyperEVM. Altitrace fills this gap with purpose-built tooling.

## The Problem

### Existing Limitations
- **Generic Solutions**: Most simulators are built for EVM mainnet, missing HyperEVM-specific features
- **Poor Developer Experience**: Weak typing, unclear APIs, and limited debugging capabilities
- **Incomplete Analysis**: Surface-level results without detailed trace analysis
- **Fragmented Tooling**: Different tools for simulation, debugging, and analysis

### HyperEVM Challenges
- Network-specific optimizations and features
- Different gas mechanics and pricing
- Unique transaction patterns and flows
- Limited existing tooling ecosystem

## The Altitrace Solution

### üé¢ HyperEVM Native
Built specifically for HyperEVM with deep understanding of network mechanics, gas pricing, and unique features.

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer First
- **Strong TypeScript Support**: Never use `any` - precise types throughout
- **Viem Integration**: Leverage the best EVM tooling ecosystem
- **Clear APIs**: Intuitive interfaces that make sense
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Examples, guides, and references

### üîç Complete Analysis
- **Detailed Traces**: Full EVM execution traces with step-by-step analysis
- **Storage Diffs**: See exactly what state changes occur
- **Gas Breakdown**: Understand where gas is consumed
- **Error Analysis**: Clear insights into transaction failures

### üì¶ Unified Platform
- **API**: Programmatic access for integrations
- **SDK**: Type-safe client library
- **Web UI**: Visual interface for manual analysis
- **All-in-One**: Everything you need in a single platform
