# AltiTrace Development Progress

## Project Overview
Transaction simulation platform for HyperEVM with REST API, SDK, and frontend dashboard.

## Current Status: API Development Phase

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Project structure created (monorepo with packages/api, packages/sdk, packages/frontend)
- [x] Architecture design completed
- [x] Technology stack selected (Node.js + Fastify + Viem + TypeScript)
- [x] Development roadmap defined
- [x] evmstate integration strategy planned
- [x] SDK interface design completed

### âœ… Completed (Recently)
- [x] API endpoints design
- [x] API dependencies installation with Bun
- [x] API server structure creation
- [x] Strict TypeScript configuration
- [x] HyperEVM client implementation (Viem)
- [x] Basic simulation endpoints
- [x] Health check endpoints
- [x] Error handling & validation
- [x] API documentation

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Advanced simulation features (state overrides)
- [ ] Execution tracing integration

### ðŸ“‹ Pending
- [ ] HyperEVM RPC client implementation (Viem)
- [ ] Core simulation engine
- [ ] Tracing integration
- [ ] SDK implementation
- [ ] Frontend development
- [ ] Testing & validation

## Next Steps
1. Complete API design and setup
2. Install dependencies (Fastify, Viem, TypeScript)
3. Create server structure with strict typing
4. Implement HyperEVM connectivity with Viem

## Key Decisions Made
- **Backend**: Node.js + Fastify for performance
- **EVM Library**: Viem (strict TypeScript, modern patterns)
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Tracing**: evmstate wrapper approach
- **SDK**: TypeScript with strict types and modern async/await
- **Frontend**: Next.js + TailwindCSS

## Development Standards
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Full type safety
- Modern async/await patterns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Best practices compliance
