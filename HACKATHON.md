# HyperEVM Transaction Simulator

## Description

Create a comprehensive transaction simulation platform specifically designed for HyperEVM. This tool will serve as essential infrastructure for the HyperEVM ecosystem, enabling developers, DeFi protocols, and users to simulate, debug, and optimize their transactions before execution.

## Features

###Â Primary Focus: HyperEVM Transaction Simulation

The platform must provide comprehensive transaction simulation capabilities for HyperEVM, including:

1. **Transaction Simulation Engine**

- Accurate simulation: 100% accurate gas usage breakdown and execution results
- Real-time state: Simulate against current HyperEVM network state
- Historical simulation: Support simulation against past blockchain states
- Custom parameters: Full control over transaction inputs, gas settings, and execution context

2. **Advanced Simulation Features**

- State overrides: Modify contract storage, balances, and blockchain conditions
- Account impersonation: Simulate transactions from any address without private keys
- Bundle simulations: Test chained, interdependent transactions
- Contract code editing: Test bug fixes by modifying contract source code
- Access list generation: Create optimized access lists for gas efficiency


3. **Transaction Analysis & Insights**

- Asset & balance tracking: Detailed ERC-20/ERC-721 token flow analysis
- Gas profiling: Granular gas usage breakdown by operation
- Event decoding: Human-readable event logs and state changes
- Error analysis: Clear, actionable error messages for failed transactions
- Execution traces: Complete step-by-step transaction execution details


### Integration & API Requirements

4. **Developer Integration**

- RPC API: HyperEVM-compatible RPC endpoint for simulation
- REST API: Standard REST endpoints for programmatic access
- SDK/Libraries: TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for easy integration
- Documentation: Comprehensive API documentation and integration guides


5. **User Interface**

- Web Dashboard: Intuitive interface for manual transaction simulation
- Transaction Builder: Visual tool for constructing complex transactions
- Results Visualization: Clear presentation of simulation results and insights
- Shareable Results: Generate shareable links for collaborative debugging


### HyperEVM-Specific Features

6. **HyperEVM Optimization**

- Native HyperEVM support: Deep integration with HyperEVM's unique features
- Low latency: Optimized for HyperEVM's high-speed execution environment
- HyperEVM precompiles: Support for HyperEVM-specific precompiled contracts
- Cross-chain simulation: Simulate interactions between HyperEVM and HyperCore (where applicable)
